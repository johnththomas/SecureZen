This file is a Django template used for the file uploading and scanning feature of your application.

**HTML Structure and Django Template Language**

<h2>File Upload</h2>

This line creates a heading on the webpage, titled "File Upload".

<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">

This line starts an HTML form. The method="post" attribute specifies that the form data will be sent to the server using the HTTP POST method.
enctype="multipart/form-data" is necessary for forms that include file uploads. It allows the file to be sent as binary data.

    {% csrf_token %}

{% csrf_token %} is a Django template tag that provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgeries. This tag generates a token that is checked by Django when the form is submitted. It's a security feature.

    <input type="file" name="document">

This is an input field where users can select the file they want to upload. The type="file" attribute specifies that the input should be a file upload. The name="document" attribute is important because the Django view uses this name to access the file that the user uploads.

    <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>

This button is used to submit the form. When clicked, it sends the form data (including the file) to the server.

{% if scan_result %}
    <h2>Scan Report</h2>
    <pre>{{ scan_result|safe }}</pre>
{% endif %}

This section of the template is a conditional block that displays the scan results if they are available.
{% if scan_result %} is a Django template tag that checks if scan_result (provided by the view) contains any data.
<pre>{{ scan_result|safe }}</pre> displays the scan result. The safe filter tells Django not to escape the HTML content of scan_result, which is important for correctly displaying formatted or structured data like JSON.

In summary, upload_and_report.html is a Django template for the file uploading and scanning feature. It contains a form for file uploads and a conditional section to display scan results if available. The use of Django template tags ({% csrf_token %}, {% if %}) and filters ({{ variable|safe }}) is typical in Django templates to handle data securely and dynamically.

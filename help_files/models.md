**Django Models**

In Django, a model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model. A model is the single, definitive source of truth about your data. Each model maps to a single database table.

**The FileScan Model**

class FileScan(models.Model):

This line defines a model class named FileScan. This model will correspond to a database table where information about file scans will be stored.

    file_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

This is a field in the FileScan model. It's used to store the name of the file that has been scanned. CharField is a Django data type for character fields, and max_length=255 sets a maximum character limit for the file name.

    scan_id = models.CharField(max_length=255)

Another field in the FileScan model to store the scan ID. This is likely a unique identifier returned by the VirusTotal API after a file is scanned.

    scan_result = models.JSONField(null=True, blank=True)

This field stores the scan result. JSONField is used to store JSON data. null=True allows the field to be empty in the database, and blank=True allows the field to be blank in forms.

    uploaded_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

This field records the date and time when a record was created. DateTimeField is a Django data type for date and time fields, and auto_now_add=True automatically sets the field to the current date and time when an object is created.

    def __str__(self):
        return self.file_name

This method defines the human-readable representation of the FileScan model. When you print an instance of FileScan, it will display the file name.

**The URLScan Model**

class URLScan(models.Model):

Similar to FileScan, this defines a model class named URLScan for storing information about URL scans.

    url = models.URLField()

A field to store the URL that was scanned. URLField is a Django data type for URL fields.

    scan_id = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    scan_result = models.JSONField(null=True, blank=True)
    scanned_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

These fields are similar to those in the FileScan model, serving the same purposes for storing scan ID, result, and the timestamp of when the scan was performed.

    def __str__(self):
        return self.url

Defines the string representation of the URLScan model, which in this case is the URL that was scanned.

In summary, these two models FileScan and URLScan are designed to store data related to file and URL scans, respectively. The fields in each model are intended to capture all the necessary information about each scan, such as the file name or URL, the scan result, and when the scan was performed. The __str__ methods provide a readable string representation of these objects, which is useful for debugging and working with these models in Django's admin interface or shell.

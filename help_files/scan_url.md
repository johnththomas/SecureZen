This HTML file is a Django template used for the URL scanning feature of your application.

**HTML Structure and Django Template Language**

<h2>URL Scan</h2>

This line creates a heading on the webpage, titled "URL Scan".

<form method="post">

This line starts an HTML form. The method="post" attribute specifies that the form data will be sent to the server using the HTTP POST method.

    {% csrf_token %}

{% csrf_token %} is a Django template tag that provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgeries. This tag generates a token that is checked by Django when the form is submitted.

    <input type="url" name="url" placeholder="Enter URL">

This is an input field where users can type the URL they want to scan. The type="url" attribute specifies that the input should be a URL. The name="url" attribute is important because the Django view uses this name to access the data entered in this field.

    <button type="submit">Scan URL</button>
</form>

This button is used to submit the form. When clicked, it sends the form data (the URL) to the server.

{% if scan_result %}
    <h2>Scan Report</h2>
    <pre>{{ scan_result|safe }}</pre>
{% endif %}

This section of the template is a conditional block that displays the scan results if they are available.
{% if scan_result %} is a Django template tag that checks if scan_result (provided by the view) contains any data.
<pre>{{ scan_result|safe }}</pre> displays the scan result. The safe filter tells Django not to escape the HTML content of scan_result, which is important for 
correctly displaying formatted or structured data like JSON.

{% if error %}
    <p style="color: red;">Error: {{ error }}</p>
{% endif %}

This is another conditional block that displays an error message if there's an error during the scan.
{% if error %} checks if there's an error message provided by the view.
<p style="color: red;">Error: {{ error }}</p> displays the error message in red text for visibility.

In summary, scan_url.html is a Django template for the URL scanning feature. It contains a form for users to submit URLs, and it displays results or error messages returned from the server. The use of Django template tags ({% csrf_token %}, {% if %}) and filters ({{ variable|safe }}) is common in Django templates to handle data securely and dynamically.

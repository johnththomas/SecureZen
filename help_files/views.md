This file defines two views: one for uploading and scanning files and another for scanning URLs using the VirusTotal API.

**Import Statements**

from django.shortcuts import render: Imports the render function to render HTML templates.
from .models import FileScan, URLScan: Imports the FileScan and URLScan models, which represent the database structure for storing scan results.
from .scanners import VirusTotalAPI: Imports the VirusTotalAPI class that contains methods for interacting with the VirusTotal API.
from django.conf import settings: Imports Django's settings module to access project settings like the VirusTotal API key.
from django.http import HttpResponse: Imports HttpResponse to create HTTP responses (though it's not used in the shown code).

**File Scanner View (upload_file)**
This view handles the upload and scanning of files by users.

Logging and Initial Setup: It starts by printing debug messages and initializing a context dictionary. The context is used to pass data to the template.

Handling File Uploads:
Checks if the request method is POST and if there's a file in the request.
Retrieves the uploaded file and creates a FileScan object with the file's name, then saves it to the database.

Scanning the File:
It reads the content of the uploaded file and uses the VirusTotalAPI class to upload and scan the file.
If the upload is successful (response_code == 1), it stores the scan ID and results in the FileScan object and updates the context with the scan results.
If the upload fails, it updates the context with an error message.

Exception Handling: Catches any exceptions that occur during the file upload and scanning process, updating the context with an error message.

Rendering Template: Renders the upload_and_report.html template, passing the context to display the scan results or any errors.

**URL Scanner View (scan_url)**
This view handles the scanning of URLs submitted by users.

Logging and Initial Setup: Similar to upload_file, it logs the start of the function and initializes a context dictionary for passing data to the template.

Handling URL Submissions:
Checks if the request method is POST and if there's a URL in the request.
Retrieves the submitted URL and uses the VirusTotalAPI to scan the URL.

Scanning the URL:
If the URL scan submission is successful (response_code == 1), it retrieves the scan result using a specified interval and timeout.
Creates a URLScan object with the submitted URL, scan ID, and scan result, then saves it to the database.
Updates the context with the scan result.

Handling Errors and Failures:
If the URL scan submission fails, updates the context with an error message.
Catches any exceptions during the scanning process and updates the context with an error message.

Rendering Template: Renders the scan_url.html template, passing the context to display the URL scan results or any errors.

**Summary**
Both views follow a similar structure: initialize, process a submission (file or URL), handle success or failure, catch exceptions, and finally render a template with the results or errors. The views leverage the VirusTotalAPI class to interact with the VirusTotal API for scanning, and they use Django models (FileScan and URLScan) to store scan results in the database. The primary goal of these views is to provide users with a simple interface for scanning files and URLs, displaying results directly on the web page.
